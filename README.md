# GazeML-PyTorchEval

Evaluation code for measuring mean angular error between the ground truth gaze vector of [UnityEyes](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/rainbow/projects/unityeyes/) and that of the predicted gaze vector from the trained [PyTorch model](https://github.com/yijisuk/GazeML-PyTorchTrain).

The ```.ipynb``` file is for the visualization of the model's evaluation results.
